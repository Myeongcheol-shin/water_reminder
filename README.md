# Water Reminder App 
It's an Android application made with Kotlin.
You can record the amount of water you drank, and you can check the amount of water you've drank so far.

## Features
* DataStore : Use sharedpreferences to record the amount of water you drank.
* UI : Depending on the amount of water you drink, the waves in the background of the app will change.
* character : There are four cute characters. I have plans to add more characters in the future.
* Calendar : You can check the data of drinking water by month, week, and day.
